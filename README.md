# Hey there, I'm Shaul!  

I'm a web and mobile developer based in Israel who enjoys building software solutions that are innovative and user-friendly.   
I have experience with a range of programming languages and technologies, including: 

- JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS
- JavaScript frameworks such as React and Vue.js
- Meta-frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt.js
- React Native and Expo for mobile development
- Node.js and Express for backend development
- tRPC for remote procedure calls between the frontend and backend
- SQL and NoSQL databases 
- ORMs such as Prisma and Mongoose
- Design tools such as Figma, Photoshop, and Blender

Apart from my technical skills, I'm always working on improving my soft skills, such as problem-solving, collaboration, and communication. I believe that being a great developer not only involves technical proficiency but also working well with others and effectively communicating ideas.
